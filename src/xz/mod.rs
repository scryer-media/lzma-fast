//! The `.xz` container.
//!
//! Ported from 7-Zip's `C/XzDec.c`, `C/XzIn.c` and `C/Xz.c` (public domain),
//! and checked against the xz file format specification version 1.2.1. Each
//! module names the C function it came from.
//!
//! The layers, outermost first:
//!
//! - a **file** is one or more streams, each optionally followed by stream
//!   padding ([`XzReader`] reads them all by default, as `xz -d` does);
//! - a **stream** is a header, blocks, an index and a footer ([`stream`],
//!   [`index`]);
//! - a **block** is a header, compressed data, padding and a check
//!   ([`block`], [`check`]);
//! - the compressed data is an **LZMA2 stream** with up to three converters
//!   in front of it ([`filter`], [`bcj`], [`delta`]).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::io::Read;
//! use lzma_turbo::xz::XzReader;
//!
//! # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! let mut out = Vec::new();
//! XzReader::new(File::open("archive.tar.xz")?).read_to_end(&mut out)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! Everything this module allocates is bounded before it is allocated, and
//! every bound is a documented one; see `docs/security.md`. The two a caller
//! usually sets are [`XzOptions::memory_limit`], which caps what one block's
//! dictionary may cost, and [`XzOptions::max_unpack_bytes`], which caps the
//! output of a whole file.
