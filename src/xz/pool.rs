//! Worker threads that decode whole xz blocks.
//!
//! C: `C/XzDecMt.c`, which schedules xz blocks across threads much as
//! `C/Lzma2DecMt.c` schedules LZMA2 runs. This is that idea on the pool shape
//! [`crate::mt::pool`] already uses - threads spawned on demand, parked on a
//! channel, reused across jobs - rather than on `MtDec.c`'s token ring, and
//! for the reasons the ring does not fit:
//!
//! - an xz block's boundaries are *known* before anything is decoded, from the
//!   index, so there is no discovery to serialise and no reason for a worker
//!   to hold a token while it looks for the next run;
//! - every block carries its own filter chain and its own dictionary
//!   property, so a worker cannot be built once for the stream;
//! - the block's uncompressed size is known too, which means the block's
//!   output buffer can *be* the dictionary (the same trick `Lzma2DecMt.c`
//!   plays with `t->dec.decoder.dic`), so a worker allocates one buffer per
//!   block and no dictionary at all.
//!
//! A worker therefore does the whole of a block: parse its header, decode the
//! LZMA2, run the converters over the finished block in place, and compute the
//! check - all of it off the thread that is draining the output, which is the
//! same rule the LZMA2 workers follow (see [`crate::checksum`]).
