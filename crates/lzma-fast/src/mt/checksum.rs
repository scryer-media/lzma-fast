//! Checksums computed where the bytes are, not where they are written.
//!
//! C: nothing. `Lzma2DecMt.c` decodes and writes; 7-Zip checksums a folder's
//! sub-streams afterwards, in `CFolderOutStream`, on the thread that consumes
//! the output.
//!
//! That is the trap this module exists to close. In the `MtDec` ring the
//! write callback is the only serialised section - one thread holds the write
//! token at a time - so a checksum computed by the consumer as it receives the
//! output is not merely serial, it is *inside* the decoder's critical section,
//! and it costs the decode both its own time and the queueing it induces on
//! every other worker. Measuring this crate against 7-Zip found exactly that:
//! a table-driven CRC-32 in the benchmark's sink cost 16% of an eight-thread
//! decode and turned parity into a 10% deficit (see `docs/perf-log.md`).
//!
//! So the decoder offers to do it instead, in the worker, over the block that
//! worker just produced, before it queues for the write token. Two shapes:
//!
//! - **CRC-32 and CRC-64/XZ** are computed per *segment*. A consumer's own
//!   boundaries - the files of a 7z folder, say - do not line up with the
//!   decoder's blocks, so the caller hands in the absolute unpacked offsets
//!   where its boundaries fall and each worker emits one checksum per piece of
//!   its block between them, in a single pass over the bytes. The pieces are
//!   then folded into whatever ranges the consumer actually cares about with
//!   [`crate::crc::CrcFolder`], which never re-reads a byte.
//! - **SHA-256** is not foldable, so it is computed over the whole block only
//!   and split points are ignored for it. A consumer that needs SHA-256 over
//!   an arbitrary range has to hash that range itself, on its own thread; what
//!   the decoder can do for free is the per-block digest, which is what an xz
//!   stream with check type 10 needs, because there an xz block *is* the unit
//!   being checked.
