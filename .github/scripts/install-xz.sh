# Put the xz the .xz container and encoder tests are written against on PATH,
# on every runner these workflows use.
#
# ubuntu-24.04 ships xz 5.4.5 - the release Debian reverted to after the
# CVE-2024-3094 backdoor in 5.6.0/5.6.1 - and tests/xz_container.rs drives the
# system `xz` to produce the vectors it decodes. Filters that arrived in 5.6
# (--riscv among them) are rejected there, so those tests fail on the runner
# while passing everywhere the developer works. macOS and Windows have no `xz`
# at all, which is why `tests/xz_encoder.rs` used to skip its external-decode
# tests on two of the four platforms the writer is meant to be proved on.
# Rather than skip, install a known xz ahead of whatever the image has.
#
# The version and its checksum are pinned, the way every action in these
# workflows is pinned by SHA: a build tool fetched as "latest" over the network
# is an unreviewed input, and this particular tarball has a history that makes
# that more than a theoretical objection. 5.8.3 is well past the compromised
# releases, and is the version the tests are known to pass against locally.
#
# Unix builds it from that tarball. The build is static-only. Installing a
# shared liblzma into /usr/local would shadow the system one for everything
# that links it - tar, dpkg, systemd - and a CI job has no business doing that.
# Only the `xz` binary is wanted.
#
# Windows takes the project's own release build instead: the runner's bash is
# Git for Windows', which has no `make`, so there is no autotools build to run
# there. The zip is pinned and digest-checked exactly as the tarball is, and it
# is built by the same people from the same release.
